# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes from Scratch
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm built from scratch, without using any pre-existing Naive Bayes libraries. The primary application of this project is sentiment analysis on tweets.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from tweet text data. To achieve this, we have implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular machine learning algorithm used for text classification.

## Naive Bayes from Scratch
The Naive Bayes algorithm is based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. In this project, we have built the Naive Bayes classifier from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of its inner workings.

## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. In this project, we apply sentiment analysis to tweets to predict their sentiment.

## How to Use
Clone this repository.
Run the Python script on your dataset of tweets.

Please note that this project is finished. Even though, suggestions are welcome!
